**Coven Code** is a GPL-3.0 derivative of [Claurst](https://github.com/Kuberwastaken/claurst)

The original Claurst license is preserved in full in `LICENSE.md`.

- Repository and homepage URLs updated to OpenCoven GitHub
- Landing page (`index.html`), docs, and installer scripts rebranded

## Internal Crate Name Boundary

The following Rust crate names are **intentionally preserved** from upstream:

- `claurst` (Cargo package name for the binary crate; binary output is `coven-code`)
- `claurst-core`, `claurst-api`, `claurst-tui`, `claurst-tools`, `claurst-query`
- `claurst-commands`, `claurst-mcp`, `claurst-bridge`, `claurst-buddy`
- `claurst-plugins`, `claurst-acp`

Rationale: These names appear in `[package] name` fields and across dozens of
`[dependencies]` sections in `Cargo.toml` files throughout the workspace. Renaming
them would require updating every `use claurst_*` import and every `Cargo.toml`
dependency reference — a high-risk bulk change with no user-visible benefit.
This boundary makes `git merge upstream/main` low-friction.

If you fork this repo and want to do a full internal rename, start with
`src-rust/Cargo.toml` workspace dependencies, then each crate's `[package] name`,
then all `use claurst_*` imports across the codebase.
